# Google Play Store Apps Reviews

This project is a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes the reviews of the Google Play Store app. It uses the pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries to perform data analysis and visualization.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Code Explanation
The code begins by importing the necessary libraries, which are pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Then, it loads the dataset containing the reviews of the Google Play Store app into a pandas dataframe.

Next, it performs data cleaning and preprocessing by dropping irrelevant columns and removing null values. It also creates new columns that contain the length of each review and the number of words in each review.

Then, it uses matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations that show the distribution of review lengths and the distribution of review ratings. It also uses a correlation matrix to analyze the relationship between review length, rating, and helpfulness.

Finally, it creates a word cloud that displays the most common words used in the reviews.

## Usage
To use this code, simply download the Jupyter Notebook and open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. You can modify the code to analyze the reviews of any other app on the Google Play Store by changing the name of the CSV file in the code.

You can also modify the code to perform additional data cleaning, preprocessing, or visualization tasks, or to save the data to a file or database.
